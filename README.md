# css-flexbox
It's nice to be out from the yoke of BootStrap and Foundation, and rolling my own CSS again, if only just for an intellectual exercise. This is my attempt at CSS flexbox and implementing show/hide text toggling using only CSS.  Oh, by the way, I don't like sushi, but the pics are free, so I'm using them here.  I will also note that I'm using the Cards from BootStrap 4 Alpha 2 and Alpha 6 in two of my personal projects, these are experimentation only, you should not use a technology that is still in alpha stage in production. I would also like to point out that between the realease of BootStrap Alpha 2 and Alpha 6, there were breaking changes, hence I wouldn't use this framework for a proof-of-concept demo.
